## Post-Execution Fixes (August 20, 2025)

### Phase 8 Completion: Additional GCC2 ABI Reference Cleanup ✅
**Issue**: Build failures revealed incomplete Phase 8 cleanup with remaining undefined GCC2 ABI constants

**Root Cause**: The original Phase 8 execution claimed completion but missed several critical GCC2 ABI references that were causing compilation errors after the constants were removed in Phase 2.

**Build Failure Evidence**: 
- Compilation error: `'B_HAIKU_ABI_GCC_2_HAIKU' was not declared in this scope`
- Missing object files in HaikuDepot due to compilation failures
- Git repository revision determination failure

**Additional Actions Taken**:

1. **File**: `/home/ruslan/haiku/src/system/runtime_loader/images.cpp:462`
   - **Issue**: `if (image->abi < B_HAIKU_ABI_GCC_2_HAIKU)` undefined reference
   - **Before**: Complex GCC2 vs modern ABI protection branching logic
   - **After**: Simplified to always use modern region protection handling
   - **Impact**: Eliminates remaining GCC2 ABI dependency in runtime loader

2. **File**: `/home/ruslan/haiku/src/system/libroot/os/area.c:76`
   - **Issue**: `if (__gABIVersion < B_HAIKU_ABI_GCC_2_HAIKU)` undefined reference
   - **Before**: BeOS compatibility check with GCC2 ABI constant
   - **After**: Comment indicating GCC2 BeOS compatibility removed
   - **Impact**: Eliminates legacy BeOS area protection compatibility

3. **File**: `/home/ruslan/haiku/src/kits/package/solver/libsolv/LibsolvSolver.cpp:616`
   - **Issue**: `#if (B_HAIKU_ABI & B_HAIKU_ABI_MAJOR) == B_HAIKU_ABI_GCC_2` undefined reference
   - **Before**: Conditional compilation for x86_gcc2 vs x86 architecture detection
   - **After**: Always uses modern "x86" architecture for x86 platforms
   - **Impact**: Simplifies package solver architecture detection

4. **Git Repository Fix**:
   - **Issue**: Missing git tags causing `fatal: No names found, cannot describe anything`
   - **Solution**: Set `HAIKU_REVISION=hrev1810a81205` environment variable
   - **Impact**: Resolves build system revision determination failure

**Verification Results**:
- ✅ `runtime_loader` builds successfully without GCC2 ABI errors
- ✅ `libroot.so` compiles cleanly with area.c fixes
- ✅ `LibsolvSolver` uses simplified architecture detection
- ✅ Build system no longer fails on revision determination
