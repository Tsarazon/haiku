CRITICAL ISSUE ANALYSIS - Build Getting Further But Failing
=======================================================

PROGRESS MADE:
1. Build successfully completed 1015 targets
2. Successfully created all core Haiku packages:
   - haiku_loader.hpkg
   - haiku.hpkg  
   - haiku_datatranslators.hpkg
3. Got to image creation stage:
   - "Creating image ..."
   - "Creating filesystem indices..."
   - "Populating image ..."
   - "Extracting src/apps/webpositive/bookmarks/WebPositiveBookmarks.zip ..."

FAILURE POINT:
The build fails at "Resolving package dependencies ..." stage where it tries to install external packages that have wrong architecture metadata.

ISSUE: 
The haiku.image-init-vars file was reverted back to include all external packages despite my removal. This suggests either:
1. The build system regenerates this file automatically
2. There's another configuration that controls this
3. The jam build target dependency is pulling these back in

SOLUTION:
Need to identify WHERE these external packages are being added to systemPackages and disable that source, rather than editing the generated file.
