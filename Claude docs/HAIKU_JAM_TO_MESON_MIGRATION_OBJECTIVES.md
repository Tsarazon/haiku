# Haiku Build System Migration: Jam to Meson
## Key Objectives and Strategic Goals

### Executive Summary

This document defines the key objectives for migrating Haiku's build system from the current custom Jam-based system to Meson. The migration aims to modernize the build infrastructure, improve developer experience, and specifically enable simplified cross-compilation for new architectures like ARM64.

### Current State Analysis

Haiku currently uses a sophisticated but complex build system based on Perforce Jam with extensive custom rules and extensions. While powerful, this system presents several challenges:
