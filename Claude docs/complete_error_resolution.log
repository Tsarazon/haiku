COMPLETE ERROR RESOLUTION ANALYSIS
================================

ERRORS IDENTIFIED:

1. ALL external packages (34) marked as "not installable"
2. Missing library dependencies:
   - lib:libjasper>=4.0.0 needed by haiku_datatranslators
   - lib:libfontconfig>=1.12.0 needed by haiku

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
The packages exist in generated/download/ but are not being recognized by the package dependency resolver. This is likely because:

1. Package repository configuration issue
2. Missing dependency resolution cache
3. Architecture mismatch in package database

SOLUTION STEPS:

1. Check if packages are being added to the correct repository
2. Verify that HaikuPorts repository is properly configured
3. Force regeneration of package dependency cache
4. Check if lib:libjasper and lib:libfontconfig are provided by the jasper and fontconfig packages we added

The build completed 1027 targets successfully, so the core build system works.
Only the final image creation failed due to package dependency resolution.
