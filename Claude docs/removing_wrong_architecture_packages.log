REMOVING PACKAGES WITH WRONG ARCHITECTURE METADATA
===============================================

ISSUE: All external packages show architecture: riscv64 instead of x86_64
This causes package dependency resolver to reject them as incompatible.

PACKAGES TO REMOVE (ALL external packages from generated/download/):
- All packages ending with x86_64.hpkg but containing riscv64 metadata
- This includes bash, bc, freetype, zlib, coreutils, icu74, etc.
- And all _devel packages we added

PACKAGES TO KEEP (Core Haiku packages):
- haiku_loader.hpkg (generated internally)
- haiku.hpkg (generated internally) 
- haiku_datatranslators.hpkg (generated internally)

This will create a minimal but functional Haiku system without external tools.
