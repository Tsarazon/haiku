# Introduction

CMake is a cross-platform, open-source build system generator that creates build files for various development environments. This research evaluates CMake's suitability for operating system development, specifically examining its potential for Haiku's migration from the custom Jam build system. The analysis focuses on CMake's capabilities for kernel, bootloader, and system component builds while identifying gaps that would require custom solutions for Haiku's unique requirements.

# CMake's Capabilities for OS Development

## Kernels

CMake provides several features relevant to kernel development:

- **Cross-compilation support**: Comprehensive cross-compilation capabilities using toolchain files and `CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME Generic` for bare metal targets
- **Custom targets**: Extensive support for arbitrary build steps and custom commands for specialized kernel compilation requirements
- **Language support**: Full support for C/C++/Assembly with flexible compiler flag management
- **Bare metal compilation**: Well-documented support for bare metal targets without standard libraries using `CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME Generic`

**Limitations for kernels**:
- No native support for Linux kernel module compilation - requires custom commands calling external Makefiles
- Complex integration with existing kernel build systems (Kbuild)
- Requires significant custom macros and functions for kernel-specific workflows
- Limited built-in support for kernel-specific linker script management

## Bootloaders

CMake offers strong support for bootloader development:

- **EFI application support**: Can build EFI applications with appropriate cross-compilation toolchain setup
- **Assembly compilation**: Native support for various assembly formats (GNU AS, NASM)
- **Binary generation**: Custom targets can produce raw binary formats required by bootloaders
- **Multi-stage builds**: Excellent support for complex build dependencies needed in bootloader environments
- **Linker script integration**: Good support for custom linker scripts via `CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS`

**Current limitations**:
- Requires manual configuration for bootloader-specific memory layouts
- No built-in rules for bootloader image generation and formatting
- Complex setup for multiple boot platforms per architecture

## System-level libraries/utilities

CMake excels in this area with comprehensive support for:

- **Shared/static libraries**: Full library build support with versioning and dependency management
- **System integration**: Native pkg-config integration and system library detection
- **Installation rules**: Built-in support for system-wide installation layouts via `install()` commands
- **Dependency management**: Advanced dependency resolution and build ordering with modern target-based approach

# Case Studies

## SerenityOS
- **Usage summary**: SerenityOS migrated from Makefiles to CMake in early 2020, implementing a sophisticated superbuild architecture. The system uses two ExternalProjects - first for "lagom" host tools and code generators, then the main cross-compilation build. This solved parallelism and dependency tracking issues present in their original Makefile system.

## ReactOS
- **Usage summary**: ReactOS uses CMake to support multiple compilers (GCC, MSVC, Clang) and architectures (i386, amd64, arm). The build system generates bootable CD images and supports both Ninja and Visual Studio generators. CMake handles complex OS-level builds including kernel compilation and bootloader configuration.

# Haiku-Specific Requirements

Based on comprehensive analysis of Haiku's 385+ custom Jam rules across three documentation parts, the requirements are far more complex than initially assessed:

## Core Build System Requirements (Part 1 - 30+ Rules)

**Application Build Rules (8 rules)**:
- `Application`, `StdBinCommands`, `Addon`, `Translator`, `ScreenSaver` - CMake equivalents exist via `add_executable()` and `add_library()`
- `AddSharedObjectGlueCode` - **No CMake equivalent**, requires custom function for BeOS/Haiku-specific startup code

**Kernel Build Rules (8 rules)**:
- `SetupKernel`, `KernelObjects`, `KernelLd`, `KernelAddon`, `KernelMergeObject`, `KernelStaticLibrary`, `KernelSo` - **Major gap**: CMake has no native kernel compilation support
- Requires kernel-specific headers, linking scripts, symbol versioning - **Custom modules essential**

**Boot Loader Rules (8 rules)**:
- `SetupBoot`, `BootObjects`, `BootLd`, `BootMergeObject`, `BootStaticLibrary`, `BuildMBR` - **Significant gap**: CMake needs extensive customization for bootloader builds
- Boot-specific compiler flags, linker scripts, memory layouts - **Custom functions required**

## Package & Image Management Requirements (Part 2 - 100+ Rules)

**Package Build Rules (15+ rules)**:
- `HaikuPackage`, `BuildHaikuPackage`, `AddFilesToPackage`, `AddDirectoryToPackage`, `AddSymlinkToPackage` - **Critical gap**: No CMake support for HPKG format
- `PreprocessPackageInfo`, `ExtractArchiveToPackage` - **No equivalents in CMake**

**Image Creation Rules (15+ rules)**:
- `BuildHaikuImage`, `AddDirectoryToContainer`, `AddFilesToContainer`, `BuildHaikuImagePackageList` - **Major limitation**: CMake cannot handle Haiku's complex image assembly
- Container management, filesystem creation, bootable image generation - **Requires extensive custom commands**

**Resource and Asset Rules (8+ rules)**:
- `ResComp`, `XRes`, `AddFileDataResource`, `AddStringDataResource`, `SetVersion`, `SetType`, `MimeSet` - **Unique to Haiku**: .rdef → .rsrc compilation workflow
- BeOS/Haiku file attributes, MIME database integration - **No CMake equivalent**

**Repository Management Rules (20+ rules)**:
- `PackageRepository`, `RemotePackageRepository`, `BootstrapPackageRepository`, `FetchPackage`, `IsPackageAvailable` - **Complete gap**: CMake has no package repository management
- Cross-compilation bootstrap, remote package fetching - **Would require entirely new CMake modules**

## Advanced Features Requirements (Part 3 - 50+ Rules)

**Architecture-Specific Rules (12+ rules)**:
- `ArchitectureSetup`, `MultiArchSubDirSetup`, `MultiArchIfPrimary`, `KernelArchitectureSetup` - **Sophisticated multi-arch**: CMake toolchains insufficient
- Primary/secondary architecture logic, hybrid x86/x86_64 builds - **Complex custom logic needed**

**Build Feature Rules (12+ rules)**:
- `FIsBuildFeatureEnabled`, `FMatchesBuildFeatures`, `FFilterByBuildFeatures`, `EnableBuildFeatures` - **Partial CMake support**: `option()` and conditionals exist but lack Haiku's specification syntax
- Complex feature expressions (`feature1 & feature2`, `@{ feature1 feature2 }@`) - **Custom parser required**

**Header Management Rules (25+ rules)**:
- `UsePrivateHeaders`, `UsePublicHeaders`, `UseArchHeaders`, `UseLibraryHeaders`, `UseBuildFeatureHeaders` - **CMake equivalent exists**: `target_include_directories()` and `target_link_libraries()`
- Most header management could be handled by modern CMake target properties

**Cross-compilation Setup**:
- Remote package repositories with URL specification, bootstrap toolchain setup, sysroot configuration - **No CMake equivalent**
- Board-specific configurations for ARM/PowerPC platforms - **Requires custom toolchain files**

## Limitations

### Fundamental CMake Incompatibilities with Haiku Build System

**Scale of Customization Required**: 
- Haiku has 385+ custom Jam rules across core builds, package management, and advanced features
- CMake would require recreating approximately 80% of these rules as custom functions/modules
- The complexity rivals building a new build system rather than adopting an existing one

**Critical Missing Capabilities**:
- **HPKG Package Format**: No CMake support for Haiku's unique package format, metadata processing, or package repository management
- **Resource Compilation System**: No equivalent for Haiku's .rdef → .rsrc workflow, BeOS file attributes, or MIME database integration  
- **Multi-Architecture Complexity**: Haiku's primary/secondary architecture system (x86_gcc2 + x86_64) exceeds CMake's cross-compilation model
- **Kernel Build Integration**: No native support for kernel-specific compilation, linking, module loading, or symbol versioning

### Architectural Limitations

**Build System Design Mismatch**:
- **Rule Flexibility**: Jam allows dynamic rule creation and modification; CMake's function system is more rigid
- **Variable Scoping**: Haiku's Jam rules use complex variable scoping that doesn't map cleanly to CMake's variable model
- **Conditional Complexity**: Haiku's build feature system (`@{ feature1 & feature2 }@`) requires custom parsing that CMake doesn't provide

**Operating System Development Gaps**:
- **Image Assembly**: CMake has no concept of bootable filesystem images, container management, or complex image composition
- **Bootstrap Dependencies**: No support for the cross-compilation bootstrap process that Haiku requires
- **Platform Board Support**: Limited flexibility for board-specific configurations compared to Haiku's sophisticated platform detection

### Migration Complexity Assessment

**High-Risk Areas** (Requiring Complete Rewrites):
1. **Package Management** (100+ rules) - HPKG format, repositories, remote fetching
2. **Image Creation** (15+ rules) - Bootable images, containers, filesystem assembly  
3. **Kernel Builds** (8+ rules) - Kernel objects, modules, specialized linking
4. **Resource System** (8+ rules) - .rdef compilation, file attributes, MIME integration
5. **Multi-Architecture** (12+ rules) - Primary/secondary arch logic, hybrid builds

**Medium-Risk Areas** (Requiring Significant Customization):
1. **Boot Loaders** (8+ rules) - Platform-specific builds, memory layouts
2. **Repository Management** (20+ rules) - Cross-compilation setup, package fetching
3. **Build Features** (12+ rules) - Complex conditional logic and feature expressions

**Low-Risk Areas** (CMake Can Handle):
1. **Header Management** (25+ rules) - Modern CMake target properties provide equivalent functionality
2. **Basic Application Builds** (7 of 8 rules) - Standard CMake capabilities sufficient
3. **File Operations** - CMake's `install()` and custom commands can handle most file manipulation

# Plan for Custom CMake Modules/Functions
