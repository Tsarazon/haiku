# Introduction

Meson is a modern, cross-platform build system designed for fast builds and developer productivity. This research evaluates Meson's suitability for operating system development, specifically focusing on Haiku's migration from its custom Jam build system. The analysis examines Meson's capabilities for kernel, bootloader, and system component builds while identifying gaps that would require custom solutions for Haiku's unique requirements.

# Meson's Capabilities for OS Development

## Kernels

Meson provides several features relevant to kernel development:

- **Cross-compilation support**: Native support for cross-compilation through cross-files, essential for kernel builds targeting different architectures
- **Custom targets**: Ability to define arbitrary build steps for specialized kernel compilation requirements
- **Language support**: Full support for C/C++/Assembly, the primary languages used in kernel development
- **Bare metal compilation**: Documented support for bare metal targets without standard libraries

**Limitations for kernels**:
- No native support for Linux kernel module (.ko) compilation - developers must use custom targets calling external Makefiles
- Limited support for specialized linker scripts and complex kernel linking requirements
- Missing built-in rules for kernel-specific compilation flags and constraints

## Bootloaders

Meson offers moderate support for bootloader development:

- **EFI application support**: Can build EFI applications with appropriate cross-compilation setup
- **Assembly compilation**: Native support for various assembly formats (NASM, GNU AS)
- **Binary generation**: Custom targets can produce raw binary formats required by bootloaders
- **Multi-stage builds**: Support for complex build dependencies needed in bootloader environments

**Current limitations**:
- Windows kernel driver/EFI development requires workarounds using custom targets
- Limited built-in support for bootloader-specific linker requirements
- No native rules for bootloader image generation and formatting

## System-level libraries/utilities

Meson excels in this area with strong support for:

- **Shared/static libraries**: Comprehensive library build support with versioning
- **System integration**: Native pkg-config integration and system library detection
- **Installation rules**: Built-in support for system-wide installation layouts
- **Dependency management**: Advanced dependency resolution and build ordering

# Haiku-Specific Requirements

Based on comprehensive analysis of Haiku's 385+ custom Jam rules across three documentation parts, the requirements are far more extensive than initially assessed:

## Core Build System Requirements (Part 1 - 30+ Rules)

**Application Build Rules (8 rules)**:
- `Application`, `StdBinCommands`, `Addon`, `Translator`, `ScreenSaver` - **Meson equivalents**: `executable()` and `shared_library()` can handle basic functionality
- `AddSharedObjectGlueCode` - **Major gap**: No Meson equivalent for BeOS/Haiku-specific startup code injection and libroot.so integration

**Kernel Build Rules (8 rules)**:
- `SetupKernel`, `KernelObjects`, `KernelLd`, `KernelAddon`, `KernelMergeObject`, `KernelStaticLibrary`, `KernelSo` - **Critical limitation**: Meson has no kernel compilation support
- Kernel-specific headers, no-stdlib compilation, custom linker scripts, symbol versioning - **Requires extensive custom modules**

**Boot Loader Rules (8 rules)**:
- `SetupBoot`, `BootObjects`, `BootLd`, `BootMergeObject`, `BootStaticLibrary`, `BuildMBR` - **Significant gap**: Meson lacks bootloader-specific build capabilities
- Boot-specific compiler flags, linker scripts, memory layouts, MBR generation - **Custom targets required**

## Package & Image Management Requirements (Part 2 - 100+ Rules)

**Package Build Rules (15+ rules)**:
- `HaikuPackage`, `BuildHaikuPackage`, `AddFilesToPackage`, `AddDirectoryToPackage`, `AddSymlinkToPackage` - **Complete gap**: No Meson support for HPKG format
- `PreprocessPackageInfo`, `ExtractArchiveToPackage`, `AddDriversToPackage` - **No Meson equivalents**

**Image Creation Rules (15+ rules)**:
- `BuildHaikuImage`, `AddDirectoryToContainer`, `AddFilesToContainer`, `BuildHaikuImagePackageList` - **Major limitation**: Meson cannot handle complex OS image assembly
- Container management, filesystem creation, bootable image generation - **Would require external build system integration**

**Resource and Asset Rules (8+ rules)**:
- `ResComp`, `XRes`, `AddFileDataResource`, `AddStringDataResource`, `SetVersion`, `SetType`, `MimeSet` - **Unique to Haiku**: .rdef → .rsrc compilation workflow
- BeOS/Haiku file attributes, MIME database integration - **No Meson equivalent possible**

**Repository Management Rules (20+ rules)**:
- `PackageRepository`, `RemotePackageRepository`, `BootstrapPackageRepository`, `FetchPackage`, `IsPackageAvailable` - **Critical gap**: Meson has no package repository management
- Cross-compilation bootstrap, remote package fetching, dependency resolution - **Would require completely new Meson modules**

## Advanced Features Requirements (Part 3 - 50+ Rules)

**Architecture-Specific Rules (12+ rules)**:
- `ArchitectureSetup`, `MultiArchSubDirSetup`, `MultiArchIfPrimary`, `KernelArchitectureSetup` - **Exceeds Meson capability**: Haiku's multi-arch system is more sophisticated than Meson's cross-compilation
- Primary/secondary architecture logic, hybrid x86_gcc2/x86_64 builds - **Cannot be expressed in Meson's declarative language**

**Build Feature Rules (12+ rules)**:
- `FIsBuildFeatureEnabled`, `FMatchesBuildFeatures`, `FFilterByBuildFeatures`, `EnableBuildFeatures` - **Partial support**: Meson's `get_option()` provides basic conditionals
- Complex feature expressions (`feature1 & feature2`, `@{ feature1 feature2 }@`) - **Meson's language cannot express this complexity**

**Header Management Rules (25+ rules)**:
- `UsePrivateHeaders`, `UsePublicHeaders`, `UseArchHeaders`, `UseLibraryHeaders`, `UseBuildFeatureHeaders` - **Good Meson support**: `include_directories()` and `dependency()` can handle most cases
- Private/public header separation, architecture-specific headers - **Meson can manage through proper target configuration**

**Cross-compilation Setup**:
- Remote package repositories with URL specification, bootstrap toolchain setup, board-specific configurations - **No Meson equivalent**
- Complex multi-platform support (ARM, PowerPC, x86 variants) - **Requires extensive cross-file customization**

## Limitations

### Fundamental Meson Incompatibilities with Haiku Build System

**Scale of Customization Required**:
- Haiku has 385+ custom Jam rules across core builds, package management, and advanced features
- Meson would require recreating approximately 85% of these rules as custom modules (worse than CMake's 80%)
- Meson's declarative language limitations make some Haiku workflows impossible to express

**Critical Missing Capabilities**:
- **HPKG Package Format**: No Meson support for Haiku's unique package format, metadata processing, or repository management
- **Resource Compilation System**: No equivalent for Haiku's .rdef → .rsrc workflow, BeOS file attributes, or MIME database integration
- **Multi-Architecture Complexity**: Haiku's primary/secondary architecture system completely exceeds Meson's cross-compilation model
- **Kernel Build Integration**: No native support for kernel-specific compilation, linking, module loading, or symbol versioning
- **Complex Build Logic**: Meson's intentionally limited language cannot express Haiku's sophisticated build conditionals

### Architectural Limitations

**Build System Design Mismatch**:
- **Language Limitations**: Meson's non-Turing complete language cannot handle Haiku's complex build logic
- **Rule Inflexibility**: No equivalent to Jam's dynamic rule creation and modification system
- **Variable Scoping**: Meson's variable model cannot replicate Haiku's complex variable scoping patterns
- **Conditional Complexity**: Cannot express Haiku's build feature system (`@{ feature1 & feature2 }@`) in Meson's declarative syntax

**Operating System Development Gaps**:
- **Image Assembly**: Meson has no concept of bootable filesystem images, container management, or complex image composition
- **Bootstrap Dependencies**: No support for the cross-compilation bootstrap process that Haiku requires
- **External Tool Integration**: Limited ability to integrate complex external tools like Haiku's package and resource compilers
- **Multi-stage Workflow**: Cannot express Haiku's complex configure → compile → package → image workflow

### Migration Complexity Assessment

**Impossible Areas** (Cannot be expressed in Meson):
1. **Complex Build Logic** - Meson's language limitations prevent expressing Haiku's sophisticated conditional logic
2. **Dynamic Rule Creation** - Jam's runtime rule definition cannot be replicated in Meson's static declarations
3. **Multi-Architecture Conditionals** - Primary/secondary architecture logic exceeds Meson's capabilities

**High-Risk Areas** (Requiring Complete External Solutions):
1. **Package Management** (100+ rules) - HPKG format, repositories, remote fetching
2. **Image Creation** (15+ rules) - Bootable images, containers, filesystem assembly
3. **Kernel Builds** (8+ rules) - Kernel objects, modules, specialized linking
4. **Resource System** (8+ rules) - .rdef compilation, file attributes, MIME integration
5. **Multi-Architecture** (12+ rules) - Primary/secondary arch logic, hybrid builds

**Medium-Risk Areas** (Requiring Significant Workarounds):
1. **Boot Loaders** (8+ rules) - Platform-specific builds, memory layouts
2. **Repository Management** (20+ rules) - Cross-compilation setup, package fetching
3. **Build Features** (12+ rules) - Complex conditional logic and feature expressions

**Low-Risk Areas** (Meson Can Handle):
1. **Header Management** (25+ rules) - Meson's `include_directories()` and dependency system adequate
2. **Basic Application Builds** (7 of 8 rules) - Standard Meson capabilities sufficient
3. **Simple File Operations** - Basic file copying and installation

# Plan for Custom Meson Modules/Functions

Given the analysis of Haiku's 385+ Jam rules, Meson would require even more extensive customization than CMake, with some functionality impossible to implement due to Meson's language limitations:

## HaikuCore Module (Replacing 30+ Core Rules)

- **remote_package_repository()**: Configure remote package sources
- **generated_repository_package_list()**: Dynamic package list generation
- **repository_config()**: Repository configuration file creation
- **haiku_ports_integration()**: Integration with HaikuPorts package system
- **Issue**: Package repository management must be handled externally
- **Justification**: Repository management is central to Haiku but unsupported by Meson

**Migration Assessment**: Implementing these modules would require approximately 250+ custom Meson functions, extensive external tool integration, and workarounds for Meson's language limitations. Many core Haiku workflows (multi-architecture logic, complex conditionals, dynamic rule creation) cannot be expressed in Meson's declarative language, making this migration even more challenging than CMake.
